        <h2>Explanation of the Data</h2>
        <p>
            The <em>response</em> variable <em>y</em> is the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB Rating</a> of the movies in 
            the dataset. The _predictor_ variable _x_ is the body count is the body count that the movie produces. The dataset was
            compiled using data from the website <a href="http://www.moviebodycounts.com/">Movie Body Counts</a>. To be counted a 
            kill and/or dead body has to be visible on the screen, implied deaths like those died in the explosion of 
            the Death Star are not counted. For more details on how counts should be conducted see their guidelines at
