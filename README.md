# Best Fit Line Project for Linear Algebra

## Requirements
`main.py` is written using Python 3 syntax. In order to execute this script, you need to install [Python 3.*](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
The following python modules are needed in order to execute `main.py`:

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`

Install these modues through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

To execute (assuming `python3` is not aliased to `python`):
```bash
python3 main.py
```
